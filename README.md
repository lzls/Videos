Videos
======================

An app lists all the videos from the sdcard (except for the ones not recorded to the system db.),
where you can perform such ops as topping, deleting and playing. Also, there are lots of videos
from [YouTube](https://m.youtube.com) that you can find to play in the `Online Videos` plate of
the application homepage.

_NOTE: if you are satisfied with this application and **only planed to be a user**, it is
recommended you download one of the [officially signed installation packages](
https://github.com/lzls/Videos/blob/release/app.json) in order to get support for code hotfix and
help me collect crash usages of this app from your device._

## Features
- Videos are listed and classified by each item for the videos under the same directory or just
  a standalone file.
- Top a recently viewed or favourite video directory or video from the list.
- Delete all the videos within a directory or a single video file.
- Rename a video file or make an alias for a video directory.
- Share a video file to another app.
- View the details of a video file/directory.
- Search the videos matching all of the search key words.
- Play a local video from the app list or across from an other app (such as a file manager/explorer).
  Audio files are also permitted in the latter case.
- Play an online audio/video stream by entering a direct URL or choosing a publicly shared
  YouTube video/playlist from the Online Videos page.
- A set of useful, typical, and even awesome ops for the audio/video playbacks.
- Simple and smooth UI with split screen, popup window and day/night mode support.
- Crashes are auto reported and users can send their suggestion or problems they encountered, all of
  which help make this app much better.
- Hot and cold updates support to continuously let user get the latest product for bug fixes,
  feature enhancements, etc.
- Good support for devices with API 16+, very large font size and right-to-left layout direction.
