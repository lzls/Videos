Videos
======================

An app lists all the videos from the sdcard (except for the ones not recorded to the system db.),
where you can perform such ops as topping, deleting and playing. Also, there are some handy TV
live streams that you can find to play in the `Online Videos` section of the application homepage.

## Features
- Videos are listed and classified by each item for the videos under the same directory or just
  a standalone file.
- Top a recently viewed or favourite video directory or video from the list.
- Delete all the videos within a directory or a single video file.
- Rename a video file or make an alias for a video directory.
- Share a video file to another app.
- View the details of a video file/directory.
- Search the videos matching all of the search key words.
- Play a local video from the app list or across from an other app (such as a file manager/explorer).
  Audio files are also permitted in the latter case.
- Play an online audio/video stream by entering a direct URL.
- A set of useful, typical, and even awesome ops for the audio/video playbacks.
