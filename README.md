Videos
======================

An app lists all the videos from the sdcard (except for the ones not recorded to the system db.)
in various order, where you can perform such ops as topping, deleting and playing. Also, there are
lots of videos from [YouTube](https://m.youtube.com) that you can find to play in the `Online Videos`
plate of the application homepage.

_NOTE:_
- _Starting from version **2.5-beta01**, the subsequent major code of the project (including
  new features and security enhancements, etc.) will no longer be open source to prevent the project
  from being further stolen and simply packaged then put on Google Play for profit purpose. It is
  also for consideration of the possible commercial development of the project in the future._
- _If you are satisfied with this application and **only planed to be a user**,
  it is recommended you download one of the [officially signed installation packages](
  https://gitlab.com/lzls/Videos-Server/-/raw/master/app/Android/app.json) in order to get support
  for code hotfix and help me collect crash usages of this app from your device._

## Features
- Videos are listed and classified by each item for the videos under the same directory, all of
  which can be sorted by their name/date/size in the asc/desc order.
- Top a recently viewed or favourite video directory or video from the list.
- Search for videos matching all of the search key words，which will be sorted by their relevancy
  by default.
- Play a local video from the app list or across from an other app (such as a file manager/explorer).
  Audio files are also permitted in the latter case.
- Play an online audio/video stream by entering a direct URL or choosing a publicly shared
  YouTube video/playlist from the Online Videos page.
- A set of useful, typical, and even awesome ops for the audio/video playbacks.
- Simple and smooth UI with split screen, popup window and day/night mode support.
- Crashes are auto reported and users can send their suggestion or problems they encountered, all of
  which help make this app much better.
- Hot and cold updates support to continuously let user get the latest product for bug fixes,
  feature enhancements, etc.
- Good support for devices with API 16+, very large font size and right-to-left layout direction.
